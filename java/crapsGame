//This program is used to simulate the Craps dice game
//To win in this game sum of two dice must be 7 or 11 (natural number)
//if your sum is 2,3 or 12 (craps number) then you automatically lose
//if your sum is another value then natural or craps number then the sum is called points
//player then roll two dice and if the sum of the new roll is equal to the point then the player wins else the player lose
